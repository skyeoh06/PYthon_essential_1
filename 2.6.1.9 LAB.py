# Scenario
# Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the results of four basic arithmetic operations.

# The results have to be printed to the console.

# You may not be able to protect the code from a user who wants to divide by zero. That's okay, don't worry about it for now.

# Test your code - does it produce the results you expect?

# input a float value for variable a here
a=float(input("Please enter the first number: "))
# input a float value for variable b here
b=float(input("Please enter the second number: "))

# output the result of addition here
print("addition: ",a+b)
# output the result of subtraction here
print("subtraction: ",a-b)
# output the result of multiplication here
print("multiplication: ",a*b)
# output the result of division here
print("division: ",a/b)

print("\nThat's all, folks!")
